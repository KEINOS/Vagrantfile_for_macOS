#  Vagrantfile for sharing files from Host OS to Mojave Guest OS
# =============================================================================
# This Vagrantfile creates a sample file in the directory of this Vagrantfile
# and shares it's directory to the Guest OS (VM=Mojave, OSX 10.14.1).
#
# IMPORTANT:
# ----------
# You will be asked the **admin password of the Host OS** while mounting the NSF 
# volume. The messages will be:
#   > ==> default: Exporting NFS shared folders...
#   > ==> default: Preparing to edit /etc/exports. Administrator privileges will 
#   >     be required...
#   > Password:

# Preparation (These will run on every 'vagrunt up')
